Our baseline browser support for our websites. There are two levels of support.

## Full support

Any browser with full support needs to be pixel perfect and all functionality should work.

| Browser | Version |
| ------- | ------- |
| Chrome | Should work for the last 3 [stable major versions](https://www.chromestatus.com/features/schedule) |
| Firefox | Should work for the last 3 [stable major versions](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Calendar) |
| Safari | [latest major version](https://developer.apple.com/safari/technology-preview/release-notes) |
| IE | 11 or greater |
| Edge | Latest |
| Opera | Should work for the last 3 [stable major versions](https://www.opera.com/docs/history/#history) |

## Accessible support

The content on these browsers should be readable but it does not have to look perfect.

| Browser | Version |
| ------- | ------- |
| Chrome | 49 |
| Firefox | 45 |
| Edge | 14 |

Any browser not mentioned here is not supported and therefore not tested.

### Testing on different browsers

The team has an account with [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com) to test your site on browsers you don't have installed or different versions. You can find the teams email and password in our credentials document.
