## Etiquette

### Approval with suggestions for trivial changes
Reviewers may consider approving a branch with the caveat that issues they've identified are resolved or considered, rather than marking the branch *needs fixing* on Launchpad or *request changes* on GitHub.

They may only do this when a branch requires a small number of trivial changes (e.g. moving files, fixing typos, renaming variables, small CSS tweaks), and they have reason to expect that they may block progress by not being available for a second review – e.g. because of different time zones.

It is the branch author's responsibility to ensure they have addressed these suggestions before merging their branch. They still should seek an additional review following their changes wherever possible.
