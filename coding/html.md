This document outlines the rules for writing HTML documents and fragments across all of our codebases.

## General rules

We write HTML5 markup, following XHTML standards for readability.
General rules for all HTML documents are:

 - HTML documents should use HTML5 `doctype` - `<!DOCTYPE html>`
 - Indent using 2 spaces
 - Tags and attributes should be lowercase (`<p class="intro">` not `<P CLASS="intro">`)
 - Use double quotes for attribute values
 - Close all elements - either a closing tag (`<p>...</p>`) or self-closing (`<img src="jeff.jpg" />`)

## Images

  - Use `alt` attributes on `img` elements
  - Use null `alt` text (`alt=""`) and no `title` attribute on `img` elements for images that Assistive Technology should ignore
