This document outlines the tools and services we use to increase efficiency.

## Assets manager

All assets are stored on our [assets manager](https://manager.assets.ubuntu.com/) website, where you have the option to [create](https://manager.assets.ubuntu.com/create) or [search](https://manager.assets.ubuntu.com/create) for an asset.

## Demos

From the [./run demo](https://run.demo.haus/) website you can view all the [running demos](https://run.demo.haus/), [stop a demo](https://run.demo.haus/stop) or create a [new demo](https://run.demo.haus/start).

## Website deployment

On our [deployment portal](http://releases.demo.haus/) you can find a list of links to the staging demo for our websites. Also it indicates whether or not the website is up to date and gives you the option to deploy by clicking the "Release" button.
Alternatively, any website can be deployed from [Jenkins](https://jenkins.canonical.com/webteam/).
