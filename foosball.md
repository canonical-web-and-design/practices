# The team foosball rules

Outlined below are the official Canonical webteam rules for foosball:

## Doubles rules

**Best of three**: The winning side is the first side to win two games

**Win by two**: Each game must be won by a margin of two goals

**Flip for it**: When playing a third game, a coin-toss will decide who gets to choose side

- *"Tails for Wales"*: For the toss, the side with the most convincing association with Wales is tails

**Scorers switch places**: After each goal, the two players on the side who scored the goal must swap places

- *No other switching*: This is the only situation under which the players are allowed to switch places

**Spinning**: Feel free to spin the players (good luck with that)

**Being 10-balled**: The players on a side who is beaten 10-0 in a game must swap shirts/tops

- *This rule is purely theoretical, and should not be used on real human beings*

**"Lifting"**: When lifting the table, the lifting player must say "lifting", or "hoisting"

- *Warning*: If you don't conform to this rule, other players may disapprove
