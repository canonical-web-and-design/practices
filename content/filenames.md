title: Filenames
description: Filename recommendations for files linked from websites
---

We should carefully consider the filenames of files that we link to from our websites. This helps to accurately describe the file's contents in URLs and if users choose to download the files.

## Documents

Documents (e.g. PDFs) linked from websites should follow this format:

```
canonical-{topic}-{year}-{month}-{day}.{ext}
```

Keep the "topic" succinct, and use only lower-case letters. For example:

```
canonical-openstack-delivery-2017-08-06.pdf
```
